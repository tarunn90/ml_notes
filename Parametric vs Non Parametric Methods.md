# Parametric
* We learn a function with a **fixed number of parameters** and make strong assumptions about the **functional form** of the model 
* Learn parameters, and then discard the training data

# Non Parametric Methods
- These CAN HAVE PARAMETERS, e.g., "K" for KNN 
- Number of "parameters" **increases with training size**
- Keep training data for prediction
- E.g., KNN

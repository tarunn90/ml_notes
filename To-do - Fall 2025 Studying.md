			- [x] What’s the motivation for self-attention?
			- [x] Why would you choose a self-attention architecture over RNNs or CNNs?
			- [x] Why would you need multi-headed attention instead of just one head for attention?
			- [x] How would changing the number of heads in multi-headed attention affect the model’s performance?
